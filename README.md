# API Gateway & Service Registry

### Description

The API Gateway & Service Registry is a project that provides a centralized gateway for managing and routing API requests to different microservices in a distributed system. It also acts as a service registry, keeping track of the available services and their locations. This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

### Features
